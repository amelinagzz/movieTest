Here I'm supposed to write a 2-5 sentence synopsis of a movie.
But it's not happening today.
Maybe tomorrow.
This is 4 lines :)

The Heiress: Scarlett Johansson
Col. Mustard: George Clooney
The Step Daughter: Lady Gaga
The Handyman: Brad Pitt
The Butler: Danny DeVito

I would suggest other actors and actresses. 
Those are out of budget.
